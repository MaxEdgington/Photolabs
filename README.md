## Overview

Welcome to Photolabs, an evolving photo-sharing platform designed for those who see life through a different lens. While the platform offers a rich array of categorized photographs, we are actively fine-tuning the user experience.

## Features

### Implemented

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Wander through a curated grid of photo cards framed under a responsive navbar.
- **Rich Categories**: Select from an assortment of topics like 'People', 'Nature', 'Travel', 'Animals', and 'Fashion' to personalize your visual journey.
- **Interactive UI**: Heart your favorite photos and watch them respond; it's interaction made beautiful.
- **Modal Exploration**: Tap on a photo to explore a modal filled with similar captures and learn about the photographer.

### In Progress

- **Modal Styling**: We're aware the modal cards are currently not styled to perfection. Work is in progress to refine the CSS for a smoother visual experience.
- **User Profiles**: User profiles are on the drawing board but have not yet been implemented.
